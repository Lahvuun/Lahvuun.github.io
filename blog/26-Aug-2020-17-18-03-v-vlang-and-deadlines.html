        <h1>V (vlang) and deadlines</h1>
        <p>Medvednikov's constant inability to keep up with deadlines (that he set himself) was amusing.<br>
        Maybe that's because I suffer from the same problem.<br>
        Knowing how Alexander handles criticism he would probably claim that I am jealous of his "success".<br>
        But the most likely reason is that I wanted to see his scam fail.</p>
        <p>In any case, here's a few instances off the top of my head.</p>

              <time datetime="2019-06-29T14:52:36Z">Jun 29, 2019</time>: a notice about V being in alpha stage <a href="https://github.com/vlang/v/commit/0afcadcfd1f7c93cb8497e09f442b7a20bde2043">is added</a>.
              Likely as a way to combat the complaints about the language missing pretty much every feature that was claimed to be ready:
              "Folks, chill, it's alpha, definitely not vaporware and I definitely won't run away with the money of dumb techbros who believe every fairy tale";
